# TechHistoria

TechHistoria is a web application that allows users to explore major technological advancements from the 20th century to the present day.

# Features

- **Browse Technological Advancements**: Users can view a comprehensive list of major technological advancements.

- **Detailed Information**: Clicking on each advancement provides detailed information, including the title, year, company, image, details, and associated historical events.

- **Search and Filter**: Users can search for specific events by title and filter advancements by decade, making it easy to find relevant information.

- **Add New Events**: Users can contribute to the database by adding new historical events at the bottom of the home page. Note: for UX, I did not add the ability to add associated events ID even though it exists in the database.

- **Error Page**: Go ahead, give it a visit. I dare you.
